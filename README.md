#This is the readme file for the application.
Hello, This is just me sharing some dopamine projects with the masses.
The concept is that this will be a network configuration generating web
application that will also have a data-entry and information search function.
And if I really get carried away, I will look into relational database pulls
and building a classful network model that will allow instantiation of network
objects that can program that can perform their own discoveries by tying in 
some netmiko and nmap. We'll see where it goes. Likely that I will try
an ansible integration at some point as well. The end result way down the line,
is a software that can accept network objectives or a more broad instruction
set. And the program logic knowing which configurations to apply to which
vendors in order to meet the expected behaviors.

But that will be a long time coming. And free time permitting. My day-job is
network engineering. Programming is what I do to keep from dying of boredom.
I love my job. But it is repititous. The only intellectual investment is in
the first time that you do it. From there out, it is just a time suck. So
automate it! 

Very little of what I will have in this program will be unique code. All rights
and licenses of the leveraged modules and module documentation carry forward
without augment. Please include licensing and attribution if you fork or pull
from this software as well. Thank you!
